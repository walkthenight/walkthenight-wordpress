Transform your WordPress site into a full-featured event ticketing system

== Description ==

If you want to sell tickets on your site and deliver them to your buyers digitally, Tickera is exactly what you need. When you use the Tickera plugin to sell and send tickets, you are essentially setting up your own hosted solution wherein you control the profits with no requirement to send a cut to a third party. Tickera allows you to check in attendees easily by using a simple and free [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ticket-checkin/id958838933?ls=1&mt=8 "Tickera iPhone check-in app") and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tickera.android&hl=en "Tickera Android check-in app") applications as well as [Barcode readers](http://tickera.com/addons/barcode-reader/ "Tickera Barcode Reader Add-on") to speed up the whole check-in process.

= PAYMENT GATEWAYS =

Tickera plugin comes with a lot of payment gateways including:

* [Mijireh](http://tickera.com/addons/mijireh-checkout/ "Mijireh payment gateway for Tickera") (80+ Gateways included)
* [Mollie](http://tickera.com/addons/mollie-payment-gateway/ "Mollie payment gateway for Tickera") (iDeal, Credit Card, Bancontact / Mister Cash, SOFORT Banking, Overbooking, Bitcoin, PayPal, paysafecard and   AcceptEmail)

= CART =
Your customers will be able to purchase unlimited number of tickets from more than one event at once!

= TICKET BUILDER =
Ticket builder allows you to create ticket templates which could be selected for each ticket type. So each ticket type (Standard, VIP, etc.) may look totally different and you can achieve that easily by dragging and dropping elements, reordering, changing font sizes and colors, ticket paper size and its orientation or even put a full-background image if you want fully custom design of the ticket.

= WHITE LABEL =
Tickera plugin is ready for white-labeling. By changing just one line of code, you'll rename the plugin by your own or client's preference

= MULTISITE SUPPORT =
Do you have WordPress multisite installed with a number of subsites and clients? Awesome! Give your clients option to create their own events and sell tickets!

= PURCHASE FORM =
Purchase form includes info from each ticket owner. New hooks allows you to add new fields for buyer or ticket owners. It would be useful if you want to add, for instance, additional field where your customers may choose food preference, set their age, sex, etc. In addition, buyers are able to download tickets directly from a purchase confirmation page – no more lost emails which have to be sent manually, lost attachments or server issues which prevent tickets to reach your clients.
Check [Custom Forms](http://tickera.com/addons/custom-forms/ "PayPal Chained Payments gateway for Tickera") add-on and create beautiful forms which will fit into your theme's design. Control order of the elements, number of columns, set required and optional fields in an easy way.

= TAKE A CUT =
Check out [Stripe Connect](http://tickera.com/addons/stripe-connect/ "Stripe Connect gateway for Tickera") and [PayPal Chained Payments](http://tickera.com/addons/paypal-chained-payments/ "PayPal Chained Payments gateway for Tickera") Tickera add-ons which will allow you to take a percentage per each sale on your WordPress multisite network

= TRANSLATION READY =
You'll be able to translate every possible word in a [WordPress way](http://www.tickera.com/blog/translating-tickera-plugin/ "Translate Tickera plugin").

= TAX ADMINISTRATION =
Collect taxes with Tickera. Administrators can set up and manage tax rate easily!

= COMPATIBILITY =
Tickera works well and look good with almost every WordPress theme out there

= MULTIPLE TICKET TYPES =
Create multiple ticket types for one or more events, set ticket quantity limits (ticket quantity per purchase, available check-ins per ticket...)

= TICKET FEES =
Add additional fee per ticket in order to cover payment gateway, service or any other type of cost

= DISCOUNT CODES =
Create unlimited number of discount codes available for all or just certain ticket type

= CUSTOMIZABLE =
Tickera is developer friendly. Customize any aspect of Tickera with actions and filters! Extend its functionality by creating great add-ons!

= ADD-ONS & EXTENSTIONS =

[Extend Tickera](http://tickera.com/tickera-events-add-ons/ "Tickera Add-ons and Extensions") with a number of add-ons.
